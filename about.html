                    <p>
                    My name is <span style=" color:blue;"> Denilson Makotsi</span>, I am a post high school graduate and am currently learning at Moringa School.I was born in Eldoret the year 1999,
                    and am 19 years old. I went to Olympic Primary School after which i was called to join Upper Hill School  where i
                    got my secondary education, now am taking IT (programming) at Moringa School.
                    Iam working with an NGO organisation known as <span style="color: blue;">NEWSPRING FOUNDATION</span>,it aims at helping the less
                    fortunate families who cannot raise enough money to fund their children education. Iam the director here in Kenya and i can say am still getting  to learn
                    since i have a mentor who is helping me on disbursing the funds, and teaching me on how such an organisation works. I decided to take classes at Moringa since
                    i have this great ambition of becoming a developer in the coming years. Moringa is one among the very few known schools that produce some of the best coders in
                    kenya, because of this i decided to take this classes because i know i will be safe in securing a nice job in this tech growing world, especially when Kenya is
                   aiming to the <em>VISION 2030.</em> We also want to become a tech country like other developed countries like Japan. This technique will also help me in learning my engineering
                   course where i can come up with great ideas on improving housing in our country Kenya.
